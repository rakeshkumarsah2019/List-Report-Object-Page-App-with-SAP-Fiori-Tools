= OData Client Library

== Idea
The OData Client library allows to build functionality that connects to backends without worrying about all possible authentication mechanisms and without worrying about whether my functionality is executed locally in VSCode or in AppStudio.

== Supported

* Basic Authentication
* OAuth (tested with SCP and Steampunk)
* Resolves destinations when running in AppStudio

== Provided Service Abstractions

=== OData Service
Simplifies requests for metadata or get requests.

=== Catalog Service
Simplified consumption of catalog service useful for fetching annotations.

=== UI5 Repository Service
Allows deployment of applications to the UI5 ABAP Repository.

== Testing
The folders `test/manual` contains a few simple test scripts as well as sample system configurations to showcase how this library can be used. Most systems require that username/password is defined as environment variable e.g. in a `.env` file in the root of this project.
